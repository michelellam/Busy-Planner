# Auto-Planner

**Inspiration** 

We all have busy schedules and on a day when we want to be productive, the worst thing is waiting in lines. We solved this problem by creating AutoPlanner!

**What it does**

AutoPlanner uses an API that tracks foot traffic in businesses. It extracts data about the busiest hours of the day for companies searched and uses an algorithm to fit three visits to businesses of your choosing at the least busy times of the day into your schedule. The planner informs the user of this information using a Pygame display.

**How we built it**

We built this by dividing the project into two teams based on our own strengths: Backend and Frontend. Backend focused on extracting the data from the API and executing the algorithm while Frontend created a three-page display complete with text boxes and buttons to show the inputs and final schedule.

**Challenges we ran into**

The Backend team struggled with accessing the data from the API and learning the API's documentation. Both the Backend and Frontend teams had a difficult time figuring out how to incorporate JSON into the code and integrating the display with the code written to work with the API and algorithm. The Frontend team also had a hard time with making multiple text input buttons. Though we had many struggles, our team persevered.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**

Our team is proud of our hard work. We came into this hackathon intimidated and were prepared to mostly learn and maybe do a small project. However, once we grasped an idea we were excited to start and worked through the night, most of us getting little to no sleep to work on this project. We know our project is far from finished but we are extremely happy with the dedication we put into this project.

**What we learned**

The Frontend team learned the proper use of rectangles to make buttons on our display while the Backend team learned how to access APIs and the value of a planning stage. By following each step as we had written out, adjusting along the way, and documenting each step, we were able to complete a complex algorithm.

**What's next for AutoPlanner**

The main goal for AutoPlanner would be to create a fully developed app. We would want to include integration with other general calendar apps so that once a schedule is created, users can choose to move the scheduled events to their regular calendar. This way, users could get reminders for events. Our display would also be shown in a calendar format, showing a single day with time slots designated for the scheduled events. With this feature, users would be able to pick how many hours an activity is and businesses would be categorized based on function. For example, restaurants could mainly be scheduled around a range of meal hours.
